Resume Screening System that helps filter and evaluate resumes efficiently
Built a Resume Screening System that helps filter and evaluate resumes efficiently using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Instead of manually going through hundreds of resumes, this project automates the process by analyzing key skills, qualifications, and experience mentioned in candidate profiles.

What it does:

Reads and processes resumes in different formats.

Extracts important details like skills, education, and work experience.

Matches resumes against job descriptions to identify the best candidates.

Saves recruiters time by providing a ranked list of suitable profiles.

Tech Stack:

Python (NLP, Machine Learning)

Libraries: NLTK / SpaCy / Scikit-learn (for text processing and classification)

Pandas, NumPy (for data handling)

Impact:
This project demonstrates how AI can make hiring faster, fairer, and more efficient by automating the first round of resume screening.
